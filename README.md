The program analyzes the dynamic behavior of a dam in given dimensions. It begins by assessing the dam's response to its self-weight through two stages: a rough mesh and a refined mesh.
The main focus is on modal analysis. It generates modal eigenvectors, representing structure displacements, and eigenvalues, indicating the magnitude of these displacements. Additionally, it calculates the natural frequencies and periodic times for each mode.

According to individual parts of the analysis, we examine the refined mesh under initial and unit loads at various points. These loads are immediately removed at time zero.
Additionally, we analyze the dam's response to a specified ground acceleration. This involves determining the displacement of a selected node over the duration of the ground acceleration and calculating the overturning moment at the dam base relative to a specified node.
